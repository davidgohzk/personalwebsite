              <p>
                I'm a developer from Singapore. I am a student at the National
                University of Singapore majoring in Computer Science. I studied
                at NUS High School of Math and Science for my secondary and
                pre-tertiary eduction
              </p>
              <p>
                I first started programming when my school introduced Python
                during my first year. I was amazed how I was able to control the
                behaviour of the computer just through lines of text and this
                inspired me to explore the different capabilities of computing.
              </p>
              <p>
                My ambition is to use my experiences and passion in computing to
                help and enhance others using technology!
